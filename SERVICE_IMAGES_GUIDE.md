## After Adding Images

Once you've added your images with the correct filenames, let me know and I'll update the HTML to use these local images instead of the placeholder Unsplash URLs.

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Use actual project photos** - Customers trust real work over stock photos
2. **Ensure good lighting** - Clear, well-lit photos showcase quality
3. **Show finished work** - Display completed projects, not work-in-progress
4. **Include variety** - Different angles and project types per service
5. **Optimize file size** - Compress images to under 200KB each for faster loading

## Current Placeholder URLs (to be replaced)

These are the temporary Unsplash URLs currently in use:
- Service 1: `photo-1600585154340-be6161a56a0c`
- Service 2: `photo-1522708323590-d24dbb6b0267`
- Service 3: `photo-1565183938294-7563f3ff588d`
- Service 4: `photo-1572293553514-09ccc01aa738`
- Service 5: `photo-1552321554-5fefe8c9ef14`
- Service 6: `photo-1567521464027-f127ff144326`

Once you add your custom images, these will be replaced with the local paths above.
